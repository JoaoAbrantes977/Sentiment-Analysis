@GREGW1820 @BonnieJAH52 @BlackCrossBand @HolenaJohn @tech_euphoria @Lmarkn @SpeakerPelosi Trump made over 2 billion while in office,how much did tax payers spend for him to golf and stay at Mar-a-lago? How much did Jared and Ivanka make during his presidency? You don‚Äôt think trumps power and their own positions in the White House helped them make the 100s of millions?
@NikkiHaley You have no shame. Trump put babies on rooms that looked like jail. He didn't fix anything, he behaved like a monster, but it looks that it what you like.
@robreiner why they still support this criminal is unbelievable!  to me all this Republicans are criminals for following trump!
You know, I really get his point.

He started by fiercely criticizing Trump for his role in suborning the 1/6/21 assault on the Capitol. 

He finished by making a kiss-the-ring trip to Mar-a-Lago several weeks later and emasculating himself before our disgraced ex-president. https://t.co/kDuKyLfuIy

@ProudElephantUS I have a feeling McCarthy through Mitch under the bus with Trump. He may have told Trump he was all wrong and he went along with Mitch just to have the power to turn things around now. Maybe true, maybe false promises. Well y have to wait and see now.
@robreiner Your obessesion with Trump is daunting. Are you trying to make up for your own shortfalls?
@RonFilipkowski Does anyone knows why Donald Trump is not back on Twitter, now his account is restored? His social media app can‚Äôt compete with Twitter, in terms of installed base and reach, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense.
@RightWingCope So why is he selling Trump 2024 merchandise if he‚Äôs still in charge?
@ArbiterofCool Because he's becoming irrelevant and needs to start a fight with someone (or this is also his way of begging to get on someone's radar).

It's Trump's desperate ploy for publicity.
@Demo2020cracy That's why they hate and fear Trump.
@ForeverHopefu13 @GeorgePapa19 I agree with you! We have lost all faith in our system! They have figured out how to rig elections after Trump won and they will never loose again. The fact that the courts don't care shows how deep the corruption goes. We have lost our country.
Joe Biden has been in the "game" 50 fucking years! Trump showed up in 2016! They blame everything on Trump, like the border crisis, but Trump had it under control! These incompetent, lazy, ignorant, lying democrat and RINO bitches still can't do a thing right! BS divisive rederik
@NHrosie57 @MollyJongFast 2) Ruby Freeman AGAIN.  She's been through enough caused by his lies! Trump is going to get her physically attacked by one of his deranged followers.  Good news is  she filed a defamation lawsuit against him for this latest attack.   https://t.co/JN3EOTzc7j
@FoxNews How about ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Biden's FCC nominee Gigi Sohn shared HORRIFIC, INCENDIARY, TYPICAL LEFT HATERED  tweet calling Trump a 'raggedy white supremacist president'.  You‚Äôre getting soft fox I guess Paul Ryan is pulling in the reins

@BillTzamaras Going back to 2016 Trump would remind his crowds of their love for the Second Amendment, and they had the guns. In Albuquerque, New Mexico homes of local Democrats have been fired upon recently. This is Trump's civil war.
@SenSanders We need a balanced budget and that's that
BTW in 2022 "Trump's tax cuts" brought in 4.7 trillion in revenue, the highest total in US history
Trump has yet to see that his influence is waning.

Why hasn't he held a single rally since announcing his next bid for president?  Sick (both physically), and in every other way???

@POTUS Not going to border for 2 yrs is a disgrace for our President. 5+ million illegals have crossed our borders because you do nothing to stop them. It‚Äôs your responsibility to stop these illegals. President Trump would have done that to stop this invasion.
Take heart,   All you who have called upon HIS Holy name.. All you have believed in His slavation.. For he soon will come and show his salvation to you.. At the last trump. Take courage.
