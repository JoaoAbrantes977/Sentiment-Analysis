# Sentiment-Analysis
Projeto da Cadeira de Tecnologias de Redes Sociais
 
On this project i scrapped some tweets from Twitter, and did sentiment analysis on them using VADER, spaCy, NLTK, TextBlob. I also used matplotlib to show bar charts with the names of the entities and verbs found on the tweets.
