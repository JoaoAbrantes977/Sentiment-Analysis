# Sentiment-Analysis
Social Media Tecnologies Project

On this project I scrapped some tweets from Twitter, and did sentiment analysis on them to obtain positive and negative tweets, to achieve this I used using VADER, spaCy, NLTK and TextBlob. I also used matplotlib to show bar charts with the names of the entities and verbs found on the tweets.
